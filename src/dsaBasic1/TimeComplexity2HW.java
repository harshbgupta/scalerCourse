     Exp: The outer loops runs from 1 to 2^ N.

    So, worst case TC will be O((2^N)^2) = O(4^N).

     ANS: O(N^2)
     Exp: The nested for loop will have time complexity of O(N^2) and as during the loop run it also increments the
     variable i greater sqrt(N) the while will stop after the nested loop stops.Hence final time complexity will be O(N^2)
