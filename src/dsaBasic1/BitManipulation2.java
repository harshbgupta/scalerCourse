         after subtracting the number by 1 it flips the bits till rightmost 1( including the right most 1)
         now if we take & operation with original and this new number it'll turn all
         bits zero till second rightmost bit in original number and now replace the original with this one

         let's do A & B             A & B => 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
